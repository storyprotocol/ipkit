# Custom Theme Example

The same simple setup as the [simple-setup example](../simple-setup/README.md), but with a custom theme called `my-theme` defined in [`app/base.css`](./app/base.css), and passed to the `StoryKitProvider` in [`app/Providers.tsx`](./app/Providers.tsx).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
