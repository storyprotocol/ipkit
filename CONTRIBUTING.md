## About this repository

This repository is a monorepo.

- We use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for example applications.

### IpKit component structure

This repository is structured as follows:

```

        ├── providers
        └── components/{component name}
        │   ├── __docs__

        │   ├── {component name}.tsx
        │   └── index.ts
        └── hooks

```

## Engineering Guideline

### Style

We use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling components. To avoid conflicts with other styles, please use the `sk-` prefix for all classes.

### Testing

All new components should include basic test cases. Tests should be added within the `*.stories.tsx` file, specifically within the `play` function.

You can refer to `Checkbox.stories.tsx` and `DateInputPicker.stories.tsx` as examples.

### Component API

For any new components, we strongly recommend opening an issue in advance to discuss the component API. This helps to ensure consistency and alignment with existing components.

## Pull Request and Release Process

All pull requests should be based on the `beta` branch. Once merged into `beta`, the changes are automatically released as a beta version.

When the code in `beta` is determined to be stable by the `CODEOWNERS`, it will be merged into the `main` branch and released as a stable version.
